And thus begins my first weekly.  A major point of this is exercise is to keep engaged and up to date with both current events and current media.  I often find myself wishing I had kept more up-to-date with certain happenings, and this is my chance to mitigate any of that in the future.  With that being said, let's dive in to this week's Threekly:

# 1. **A thought problem I've been consumed with:**
## Russell's Paradox
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xauCQpnbNAM) does a great job explaining it, but in short, it deals with Set Theory.  Imagine a set that contains all sets that do not contain itself.  Does this set contain itself?  The rules of the set says it both should, and should not...

# 2. **A project I've come to love**
## Loot Project
Loot Project is the brain child of Dom Hoffman, the creator of the once loved Vine.  An entirely on-chain NFT (using SVG -- this alone is noteworthy), this project serves as the starting place for myriad games and communities.  The project defines a set of "loot" that each holder has.  Being on-chain and in a decentralized environment, Loot Project allows anyone to ideate and grow the game or community.  Some interesting spin offs are [games](https://loot-talk.com/t/on-chain-world-boss-for-adventurers/230), other [loot components](https://loot-talk.com/t/introducing-xxxloot-for-naughty-adventurers/1018/2), and even [synthetic loot](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1433110412187287560).

# 3. **A book I've been reading**
## Algorithms for Everyday Life by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
[This book](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1250118360/ref=asc_df_1250118360/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312118059795&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10268507780361795897&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010937&hvtargid=pla-300850505981&psc=1) explores algorithms and how they can apply to our everyday understanding of decision making.  While having knowledge of some algorithms helps, the authors do a great job explaining to people without technical knowledge.  From when to stop (stopping problem and secretaries problem) to recipes, this book breaks down how humans can use "machine" decision making to streamline choices and ultimately pick the best every time.
