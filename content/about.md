Spencer is an Oscar nominated child of four.  After inventing Facebook, he rode 1000 miles on camelback to diffuse forgotten landmines.  An Ashkenazi Jew by trade, and an Olympic surfer by birthright, he now lays dormant on his vast collection of pre-1995 beanie babies and Cheerio's Year 2000 pennies.
