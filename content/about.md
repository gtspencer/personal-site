Spencer Obsitnik (born **Speezy F Baby**, November 17, 1995) is an Oscar nominated child of four.  After [inventing Facebook](/facebook) and winning "Least Likely to Hyperbolize" in a grade school he did not attend, he rode 1000 miles on camelback to diffuse forgotten landmines.  An Ashkenazi Jew by trade, and an Olympic surfer by birthright, he now lays dormant on his vast collections of beanie babies, oxford commas, and Cheerio's Year 2000 pennies, where he wishes to be disturbed only by the Obamas.
