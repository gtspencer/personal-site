This is an experiment in minimum transactable value and the influence of perceptible divisibility on opinions.

One Token has a total supply of one (1) token, but is divisible up to 18 decimal points.

Many Token has a total supply of 1018 tokens, but each token is indivisible.

Each token has an equal amount of minimum transactable units (MTU).
