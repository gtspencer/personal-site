We've seen first person games.  We've seen third person games.  But what about second person games?

I sought to answer this universal, ubiquitious, and oft asked question the only way I knew how: through annoyance, frustration, and Unity3D.

The premise quickly became apparent, albeit quite simple.  You control the view of another person, while they control yours.  You have a body you can move around, but your eyes (and the control of them) belong to another.

*Why did you do this?*  Don't ask me that.
*Will this ever become a full game?*  Only when Most Unplayable Rage Bait becomes a GOTY category.
*Don't you have anything better to do than build games that would destroy even the closest relationships?*  Almost never.

This project failed to turn into a viable game.  Mostly because the iterative design work (creating satisfying levels/puzzles) would consume every waking moment of my day.  Maybe one day I'll revisit it, but for now, it serves as a fun little experiment that I, for now, have deemed unviable.
