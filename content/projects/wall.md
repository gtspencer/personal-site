This is a game about talking to a Wall.  
Unless itâ€™s about something else.  
Hard to say, really.

`Wall` is a short narrative adventure about friendship, loneliness, and staring at surfaces for meaning.

Below is the draft trailer for the game.  Steam page to come shortly, along with a new polished trailer.

Features:
- A cube-shaped companion with surprisingly deep thoughts
- Conversations that unfold as you pace
- Other rooms (allegedly)
- At least one emotionally suspicious mannequin

It is my current project, and my intended first pubicly released project.

#### Inspiration
I am, admittedly, not the best 3D artist.  I know my way around Blender, but not nearly well enough for the lofty ideas I have for games.  I had let this notion stop me from releasing to the public for as long as I've been a game developer.

One day I was staring at the default cube and thought "If I am half the designer I think I am, I should be able to make a compelling game about anything.  Even this damn default cube."  And thus Wall was born.

#### Implementation
The mechanics are simple; maybe some of the simplest I've prototyped to date.  But they also feel the most impactful, and lends well to linear explorative storytelling.

You move around a wall, stationary in a room, while it converses with you.  There are choices, branching logic, alternate environments to stumble upon, but half of the game takes place inside a 20x20 room, walking around a wall that slowly becomes your friend.
