# Hamy (Hamilton)
Hamy is a self-described creative technologist, and the name couldn't better apply.  Hamy is a socially conscious engineer, builder, creator, entrepreneur, and artist.

He actively updates his findings and learnings in life in his [blog](https://blog.hamy.xyz/), and is an established and dedicated (digital artist)[https://labs.hamy.xyz/], often instructing code to paint stunning algorithmic scenes.  Check out his (work)[https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/hamy.art/creations] as NFTs on the Tezos blockchain, or his (Instagram)[https://www.instagram.com/hamy.art/].

Here's one I particularly liked, though most of his pieces are in video form, so I highly recommend viewing them on his pages.  I'm just too paranoid/lazy to apply for a Instagram API key and I'm not about to imbed an mp4 in this site.
